zz_synth
========

A basic software synthesiser implemented in C++11. 

Developed and tested under Linux (3.16.0-4-amd64) with GCC (4.9.1) No support for other platforms at this point.

This a toy-project for me to try various things. Comments and feedback are more than welcome. 

Requirements:
-------------
The unit testing is performed with the aid of Google Unit Testing and Google Mocking Frameworks. These are assumed to be available in the system on which the synthesiser is run.
