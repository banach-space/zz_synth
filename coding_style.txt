====================================
  ZZ-SYNTH: THE CODING STYLE
====================================
This library adheres to Google's C++ coding style:

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#Function_Names

Known divergences from the above standard:
- Line lengths must not be longer than 120 characters, but it is recommended
  that they don't exceed 100 characters;
- Indentation is 4 spaces at a time;
- other?

Further remarks/additions:
- Public member functions (i.e. interface avaiable for users) are documented/commented
  in the corresponding header file, private and protected member functions are documented
  in the corresponding implementation file.

For consistency, three template files are provided:
- /templates/class_name.h
- /templates/class_name.cc
- /templates/testbench.cc
These files should be used when defining new classes or adding a testbench.
