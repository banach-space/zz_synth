  ZZ-SYNTH: THE CODING STYLE
====================================

This library almost completely adheres to Google's C++ coding style:

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#Function_Names

The only intentional breach/extension of this coding style is when naming
variables. The following rules are applied:

- The names of variables and data members are all lowercase, with underscores
  between words, i.e.
    char my_favourite_variable;
    int not_my_favourite_variable;
- Data members of classes (but not structs) additionally have trailing
  underscores:
    char MyClass::my_favourite_variable_;
    int MyClass::not_my_favourite_variable_;
- Pointers always start with "p_":
    char *p_my_favourite_variable;
    int *p_not_my_favourite_variable;
- Constants always start with "k_":
    char k_my_favourite_variable;
    int k_not_my_favourite_variable;
- Globals always start with "g_":
    char g_my_favourite_variable;
    int g_not_my_favourite_variable;
- Allow mixing of the above prefixes. This should discourage anyone from
  defining to many globals
